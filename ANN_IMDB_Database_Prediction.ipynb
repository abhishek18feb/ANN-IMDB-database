The storytelling is so natural that it keeps you hooked from the very first scene. The emotional moments are powerful and meaningful, especially the friendship between Rancho, Raju, and Farhan. Aamir Khan brings so much honesty to the character that you can relate to his journey instantly. The humor is refreshing and perfectly timed without feeling forced. The film teaches important life lessons in a very simple yet effective way. Every scene feels memorable and worth watching again.\",\n","    \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is a beautiful celebration of friendship, life, and self-discovery. The film takes you on an emotional journey with three characters who are each dealing with their own fears. The scenic visuals of Spain are breathtaking and make the whole experience even more enjoyable. Every conversation feels real and meaningful, especially the moments of personal realization. The poetry adds depth to the narrative and leaves a lasting impact. It's one of those movies that make you rethink your priorities and appreciate life more.\",\n","    \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is a heart-warming film that beautifully portrays the power of kindness and humanity. Salman Khan delivers one of his most sincere and emotionally grounded performances. The bond between Pawan and Munni is so pure that it brings tears to your eyes. The story flows smoothly with a mix of humor, emotions, and strong messages. The India-Pakistan theme is handled with maturity and positivity. It's a movie that fills your heart with hope and reminds you that compassion still exists in the world.\",\n","    \"Barfi! is a cinematic gem filled with innocence, charm, and beautiful storytelling. Ranbir Kapoor’s performance is beyond impressive, especially with no dialogues and pure expressions. The chemistry between Barfi and Jhilmil feels so real and heartfelt. Each scene is crafted like a painting with rich visuals and soulful music. The movie explores love in its purest form, without drama or exaggeration. It stays with you long after it ends, making you appreciate the little joys in life.\",\n","    \"Race 3 is one of the most confusing and poorly written movies I’ve seen in recent years. The storyline keeps jumping without any logic or connection, making it hard to follow. Most of the dialogues feel forced and unintentionally funny. Despite having a big star cast, almost everyone seems out of place in their roles. The action scenes look unrealistic and badly choreographed. Even the music doesn’t leave any impact. Overall, the film tries to look stylish but ends up being a complete mess.\",\n","    \"Thugs of Hindostan promised a grand adventure but delivered nothing close to it. The film is painfully slow, with scenes dragging unnecessarily. The CGI and VFX feel outdated for a movie of this scale. Even great actors like Aamir Khan and Amitabh Bachchan look restricted by the weak script. The emotional moments feel artificial and fail to connect with the audience. The film lacks energy, excitement, and depth in every possible way. A huge disappointment considering the expectations.\",\n","    \"Radhe feels like a recycled version of countless action movies we’ve seen before. The storyline is predictable and lacks any emotional engagement. Most scenes feel rushed as if they were made just to finish the film quickly. The action sequences are over-the-top and make no sense logically. Salman Khan tries to carry the movie, but even his presence cannot save the weak screenplay. The supporting cast gets very little to do, and the music is completely forgettable. Overall, the film fails to entertain on any level.\",\n","    \"Adipurush had massive expectations, but the final product is extremely disappointing. The dialogues are poorly written and do not match the seriousness of the story. The visual effects look cartoonish and take away the impact of important scenes. Characters feel underdeveloped, and many moments lack emotional weight. The movie could have been a grand retelling of a timeless epic, but instead, it feels rushed and shallow. Even the background score fails to elevate the narrative. A great opportunity wasted.\"\n","\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"LZjsH1SiR_Be","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764517516322,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Abhishek Kumar Gupta","userId":"17188796790665188532"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X_test_ood_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(X_test_ood)\n","X_test_odd_pad = pad_sequences(X_test_ood_seq, maxlen=200)"],"metadata":{"id":"YurvgEhnSB_p","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764517516333,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Abhishek Kumar Gupta","userId":"17188796790665188532"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.predict(X_test_odd_pad) > 0.5"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3D-3-vjISEFt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764517517222,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":869,"user":{"displayName":"Abhishek Kumar Gupta","userId":"17188796790665188532"}},"outputId":"07572d0c-f397-424f-9033-a98c15433748"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m1/1\u001b[0m \u001b[32m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[37m\u001b[0m \u001b[1m1s\u001b[0m 853ms/step\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[ True],\n","       [ True],\n","       [ True],\n","       [ True],\n","       [False],\n","       [False],\n","       [False],\n","       [False]])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example input data\n","input_data = {\n","    \"review\": \"\"\"\n","    Barfi! is a cinematic gem filled with innocence, charm, and beautiful storytelling.
